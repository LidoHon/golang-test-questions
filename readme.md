# Go Test Questions Solutions

This repository contains solutions to various Go programming questions that I have solved. These are test questions covering various aspects of Go programming, including data structures, algorithms, error handling, concurrency, and more. You can also find the PDF of the questions here in the repo.

## Questions Covered

1. GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) using recursion
2. Memoization for Fibonacci calculation
3. Implementing higher-order functions
4. Handling panics and retries
5. Sliding window sum
6. And many more...

Each solution demonstrates different features and capabilities of the Go language, including the use of maps, slices, functions, and error handling techniques. And of course, ChatGPT helped me with some of the questions, including writing this README fileðŸ˜‚.

## Usage

Clone the repository and run the Go files to test the functions and see the output.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LidoHon/golang-test-questions.git
cd golang-test-questions
go run main.go
```
